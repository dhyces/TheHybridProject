A combination of insanity

Hello world! Thank you for checking this out! This is about a mod(pack), or "MegaMod", I am working on! Here you will learn more about the mod and what mods there are! This is an early release. It is hopefully stable, but some things are probably overpowered or underpowered and need revamped. Please leave a comment on things that need help. Thanks!

What It Does:

This mod aims to combine EVERY released and/or stable mod, at least in the released section of this forum. If you have any suggestions, leave a comment below! The mod makes everything in it compatible and depends on one another. So far it has nearly 100 new software types and 20+ new scenarios!
